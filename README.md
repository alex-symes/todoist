# Todoist analysis tool

Todoist is, as eponymously named, a todo list web app. They provide some simple analytics to help track performance, but at the end of the year provide a fuller report. At the same time there is an API that can provide full personal history (although may require a subscription). [Gustavo Saidler](https://gustavosaidler.com/data%20analysis/todoist-data-analysis/) created a great tutorial in 2018 on how to analyze Todoist data, but their api data schema has since changed. This Jupyter Notebook should provide a way to access your data. 

You will need:
* Pandas
* todoist-python
* calmap
